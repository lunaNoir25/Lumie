# Contributing to Lumie

## The Philosophy

As of now, Lumie feels like a workstation in the late 70s to early 80s, but on modern 64-bit UEFI hardware.

* Keep it simple: If a feature can be implemented in a straightforward "manual" way, we prefer that over heavy abstractions (for now).
* Stay Focused: We aren't trying to beat Linux, Mac or that other operating system I refuse to name (:3), Lumie is a fun, minimal system to prove that major (potentially) operating systems can still be made to this day with enough support and dedication. No more hobby OSs!

## How to help?

You can add a feature of your chosing to better push Lumie into modern standards!
For ideas, look at the issues page, the discussions page, current limitations or online media.

(Or add comments yourself since I never do.)

## Code Style

* Keep it clean: Use standard C11 (ISO/IEC 9899:2011) and follow the existing directory structure.
* No bloat: Every byte counts to aim for a minimal approach.

## Submission Process

You've probably seen this before, but it's very simple!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your branch, give it a descriptive name (ex: `bugfix: ()` or `feature: () command`).
3. Keep commits descriptive, like (most of) mine!
4. Open a pull request!
